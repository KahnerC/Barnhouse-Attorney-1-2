A loose localisation of one of the Ace Attorney / Haruhi Suzumiya fangames, covering the court portion of case 1-2.

Notes:

-Reconstructed from Youtube footage, leaving some "Press" answers unfilled and many inaccuracies.
-Any humour and cleverness has been lost by Google Translate, and has stayed lost by me.
-Done in Ren'py, with some dodginess to accommodate. An interpreter cooked up in another engine would fare better.
-Vision for the whole trilogy would be a pretend good faith effort from the assumption that both source franchises are Scooby-Doo ripoffs.
